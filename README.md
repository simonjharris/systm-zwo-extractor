# SYSTM zwo extractor
This is an extension of suffersync https://github.com/bakermat/suffersync. However, instead of uploading workouts to intervals.icu, 
it zips up the file and allows the user to download them. Then can them be uploaded to RGT cycling or Zwift.

This was designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Run, but could run on any container-based service.

Full credit for the extraction process goes to bakermat.
